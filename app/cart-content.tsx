/* The head band. MyCart stood without a photograph until now, on the argument
   that the page's content is the reader's own list; in the bar, though, it sits
   beside My Chamber and CyberShield, and it was the one entry there whose head
   was a flat ink band — the exception read as an omission rather than as an
   argument.
   The SAC-5 Plus panorama from Heideck: the third of the head office's three
   360° frames and the only one not already heading a band — the chambers index
   opens on SAC-10 Hybrid and My Chamber on FAC-3, so My Enquiry reads as their
   sibling without repeating either. The same 4:1 crop that survives a band this
   shallow, and its two antenna masts stand at the edges rather than the middle,
   which keeps the right half — the half the scrim clears — occupied. Framed a
   shade above centre: the absorber walls and the mast heads, not the floor. */
