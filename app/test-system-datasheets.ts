/**
 * The head office's datasheet for an instrument, served from this origin.
 *
 * This is the one place on the site that keeps a copy of a head-office PDF
 * rather than linking to it, and the reasoning is worth stating because the
 * `Documents` band a few files over argues the opposite for the nine catalogues.
 *
 * A catalogue is a forty-page brochure covering a whole branch; it is revised
 * as a whole, and the head office's download area is where a reader who wants
 * one goes. A datasheet is the two-to-nine-page sheet for a single instrument,
 * and it is what a reader who has just opened the CIT-100 row is looking for.
 * Sending them to a download area to find it again by name — on a page written
 * in German-flavoured English, listing every product in the branch — is the
 * step this table removes. These are the 2026 sheets the head office sent in
 * August 2026 (`D:\FRANKONIA\FRF\Datasheet`), and they carry no per-country
 * pricing or availability, which is what would otherwise make a copy go stale
 * in a way a reader could not detect.
 *
 * Twelve sheets, ~18 MB in the export. Nothing is fetched until a reader
 * presses the pill: the panel carries a link, not an embed.
 *
 * See `docs/source/test-systems-assets.md` §Datasheets for the ledger — what
 * each file was called at the head office, which edition it is, and which
 * instruments the head office has not published a sheet for.

 * - **One sheet, several models.** The head office writes one sheet per
 *   *product*, and a product is sometimes a family. `PSG-300` and `PSG-300A`
 *   are the 5 A and the 16 A build of one generator and share a sheet that
 *   prints both columns; the `LISN C2-16 / C4-32` sheet is titled after both;
 *   the CDN sheet is twelve pages covering every coupling network the branch
 *   sells. Pointing all of them at the one file is what the source supports —
 *   splitting a shared sheet per model would mean editing the head office's
 *   PDF, which this site does not do.
 * - **Models with no sheet.** `LISN-KFZ`, `LISN-MIL`, `ERC-6`, the PMS meters,
 *   the RSU, the four EFS probes below the EFS-18, the near-field probes and
 *   all seventy amplifiers are not in this table, because the head office has
 *   not published a sheet for them. A row with no entry simply does not draw
 *   the pill — the enquiry beside it is how a reader asks for that one, and it
 *   is already addressed to the model. Do not point such a row at a
 *   neighbouring family's sheet: a reader who downloads "the datasheet" from
 *   the LISN-MIL row and gets the C2-16's has been told something false.
