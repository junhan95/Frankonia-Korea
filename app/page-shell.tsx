 * The landing hero cycles four of these and pans each one; a page head holds a
 * single frame and does not move it. The band is a third of the hero's height
 * and a reader passes through it on the way to the page rather than landing on
 * it, so a camera move here would be motion nobody asked to watch — and every
 * sub-page would be running one.
 *
 * `at` is the frame's `object-position`. The default centre is wrong more often
 * than not: what is worth seeing in a chamber is the absorber wall and the mast,
 * not the floor, and cropping a 4:3 photograph into a band this shallow throws
 * away most of the height.
