 * The five industries the site sorts products by, shared by the chamber and

 *
 * The head office keeps these two apart: chambers are filtered by industry,
 * test systems by standard, and nothing crosses between them. But a customer
 * building an automotive EMC laboratory buys both, and the standards that
 * define their work — CISPR 25, ISO 11452 — are the same on either side.
 *
 * Only the chamber branch has industry routes; test systems dropped theirs
 * because an industry page there could only reprint one heading of the
 * standards index. The shared slug set still earns its keep: it is what lets
 * each industry group on /test-systems/standards link straight to
 * /chambers/industry/<same slug>, and what keeps one label set for both.
