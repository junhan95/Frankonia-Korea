 * The red band that closes every page, the landing included — the one
 * full-bleed primary surface a page is allowed (디자인.md §3.3).
 *
 * It used to be the site's entire contact story: a mail link and the German
 * switchboard, on a page whose reader might be in Seoul. Inviting the enquiry
 * is the band's job and carrying five addresses is not, so the primary button
 * opens the contact page and the mail link stays as the shortcut for a reader
 * who already knows what they want to write.
 *
 * Its own file rather than page-shell's, because the landing page renders this
 * band too and page-shell reads the landing's copy table — putting the
 * component there would close an import cycle between the two.
 *
 * `actions` replaces the pair on the one page where the primary button would
 * otherwise link to itself.
