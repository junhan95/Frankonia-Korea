/**
 * MyCart — what is in the basket, and the one place that knows it.
 *
 * ## Where it lives
 *
 * In `localStorage`, and nowhere else. This site is a static export with no
 * back end: there is no session to hang a basket off, and posting a reader's
 * shortlist to a third party would put their project plans somewhere neither
 * they nor Frankonia chose. So the list is theirs, on their machine, until
 * they press the button that writes the mail — the same contract the MyChamber
 * enquiry works under, and the reason the page says so out loud.
 *
 * The consequence is honest and worth stating rather than hiding: the basket
 * does not follow a reader to another device, and clearing site data empties
 * it. Neither matters for what it is for, which is one visit ending in one
 * enquiry.
 *
 * ## Why a store rather than component state
 *
 * Three components read this and none of them contains the others: the icon in
 * the header, the add button on a MyChamber result card or a model row, and
 * the cart page itself. Lifting the state to a common ancestor would mean the
 * header, which is a server component on all 130 pages, and every page under
 * it becoming client components to carry a context provider through — for a
 * list that four elements read.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` instead. It is what React offers for exactly this: a
 * value that lives outside the tree, with a server snapshot for the export.
 * The server snapshot is empty, so the HTML in the file has no basket in it
 * and the first client render matches it; the real list arrives immediately
 * after hydration.
 *
 * The `storage` event keeps two tabs of the site in step, which is not an edge
 * case here — reading a model page in one tab and the cart in another is how
 * someone actually shops.
