/**
 * The model list, with a panel under each row.
 *
 * The rows are the `.hairline-list` the chamber and test-system indexes have
 * always drawn — index, designation, descriptor, catalogue figures. What is new
 * is that a row opens: the photograph from the model page, its opening
 * paragraph and its figures slide out underneath, and the reader decides from
 * there whether to open the model page itself.
 *
 * The figures are set as text on hairlines rather than in the bordered tiles the
 * model page uses. Six boxes inside a panel that is itself inside a list of
 * bordered rows was three frames deep, and the innermost one was carrying the
 * shortest strings on the page.
 *
 * Three things this file is careful about, because they are the ones an
 * accordion usually gets wrong:
 *
 * - **The link to the model page is optional, and off.** The row used to be the
 *   only way there; then the panel carried it, as the one control inside it
 *   that was not "close". Neither branch asks for it today — see `more` — so
 *   the panel's controls are the enquiry and the basket, and the model pages
 *   are reached from a MyCart line or from the sitemap.
 * - **The panel is in the exported HTML.** It is collapsed by CSS, not dropped
 *   from the tree, so the figures are in the file a crawler reads and the
 *   rendered-HTML tests can see them. `inert` keeps the closed panel out of the
 *   tab order and the accessibility tree, which is what `display: none` would
 *   otherwise have been doing for us.
 * - **The photographs are not.** Twelve plates behind a collapsed panel are
 *   twelve downloads for a reader who opens one of them — and `loading` cannot
 *   help, because a clipped element is still on screen as far as the browser is
 *   concerned. So a frame is mounted when it is first shown and stays mounted:
 *   opening a row costs one image, and the second and third arrive only if the
 *   reader asks for them. The figure holds the first frame's aspect ratio
 *   throughout, so neither the fold nor a step through the gallery moves the
 *   page under the reader.
