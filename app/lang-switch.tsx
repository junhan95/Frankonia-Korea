 * The language switcher, which has to know where the reader currently is.
 *
 * Switching language keeps them on the page they are reading —
 * /cybershield/ ↔ /en/cybershield/ — instead of dropping them back on the home
 * page. That was worth a client component when the whole header was one
 * already; now that the header is not, this is deliberately the smallest thing
 * that can still answer the question, and site-config is all it imports.
 *
 * The alternative was threading the current path down from every page into
 * PageShell and on into the header. That is more code in more files, and each
 * of those files would then be able to get it wrong — a page that passed the
 * wrong path would render a switcher pointing somewhere else, and nothing
 * would catch it. `usePathname` cannot be wrong about where it is.
